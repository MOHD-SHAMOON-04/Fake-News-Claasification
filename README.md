**Fake News Detector**

This project is a real-time Fake News Detection web application that classifies news articles as Real or Fake using a deep learning model. The model was initially developed for the Serve Smart Hackathon hosted by IIT BHU, where I was a finalist and worked on solving the fake news classification problem. While I didn't win, I took it a step further by deploying the model locally as a Flask web app! ðŸš€

**Features**

1. Fake News Classification: Classifies news articles as "Real" or "Fake".
2. Confidence Score: Displays the confidence level of the prediction.
3. User Input: Allows users to paste news articles and get real-time predictions.
4. Flask Web App: Simple and interactive interface for easy use.

**Usage**
1. Paste any news article into the provided text area.

2. Click the "Analyze Article" button.
3. The result will show whether the article is classified as "Real" or "Fake", along with a confidence score.
